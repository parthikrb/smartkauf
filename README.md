## What is SmartKauf?

Grocery prices fluctuate depending on where you buy. Smartkauf finds grocery prices from over 10+ stores ranging from Kaufland to Whole Foods Market and allows the user to compare prices to find the best deals. We help consumers explore their different shopping options, and make better money decisions when it comes to grocery shopping.

> Today, when shopping for dinner fixings and other kitchen goods, grocery stores are faced with more aggressive price competition from online retailers like Amazon. SamrtKauf focuses on the price of groceries at supermarkets (traditional retailers). It is a smart app for saving time, spending judiciously, and sticking to a budget. This app does everything--you can browse what's in your pantry and store list, filter by store or availability (e.g., "local"), count the cost in your budget, and compare prices from different stores.
